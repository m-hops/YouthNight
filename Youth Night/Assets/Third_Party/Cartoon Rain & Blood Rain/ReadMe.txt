Cartoon Rain & Blood Rain
-----------------------------------

This package is a collection of rain particle systems with raindrop, ripple, bubble and splash effects. All rain particles support Wind Zone. There are 3 levels of rain prefab (Light Rain, Moderate Rain and Heavy Rain) in this package, each of which has a 'blood rain' version. You can just drag-n-drop one prefab into your scene to add the rain effect! 

Contains:
- 12 rain prefabs.
- 4 demo scenes.
- 4 textures for raindrop, ripple, bubble and splash. 
- 1 'bad weather' skybox.

The demo scene is located in the folder "\Assets\Cartoon Rain & Blood Rain\Demo Scene".

This asset is independent and does not require other asset to work. But this package still provides 2 demo scenes to show how to work with the unity Standard Assets. So before testing 'demo scene 3' & 'demo scene 4', please import the unity Standard Assets. You can just import the 'Water' folder ('Standard Assets\Environment\Water'). 

**********************
How to make a water surface - Just add a collider (box collider or mesh collider) to a object (such as a plane) and set the layer as "Water".
